prelude: >
    Add `QuadraticModel` implementation to Python, Cython and C++.
    Quadratic models can be represented by a degree 2 polynomial over binary,
    spin and integer variables.
features:
  - |
    Add new `QuadraticModel` class for creating quadratic models.
upgrade:
  - |
    Symbolically multiplying, subtracting and adding `BinaryQuadraticModel`s
    with different vartypes now creates a `QuadraticModel` rather than raising
    an error.
