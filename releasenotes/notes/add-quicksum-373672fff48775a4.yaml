features:
  - |
    Add ``quicksum`` function for faster summation of ``QuadraticModel`` and
    ``BinaryQuadraticModel``. Python's built-in ``sum`` continues to work, but
    ``quicksum`` will generally be faster when adding many objects.
fixes:
  - |
    Return ``bool`` rather than ``numpy.bool_`` from
    ``QuadraticModel.is_equal`` and ``BinaryQuadraticModel.is_equal`` when
    comparing empty models to numbers.
