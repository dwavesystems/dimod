features:
  - |
    Add ``QuadraticModel.set_upper_bound`` and
    ``QuadraticModel.set_lower_bound`` methods.
fixes:
  - |
    When a ``QuadraticModel`` already has an integer variable, adding it
    with ``QuadraticModel.add_variable`` with different lower or upper bounds
    now correctly raises an exception. Likewise, adding or multiplying the
    same variable symbolically with different bounds will also raise an
    exception.
