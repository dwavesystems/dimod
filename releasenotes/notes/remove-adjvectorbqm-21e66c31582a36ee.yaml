upgrade:
  - |
    ``AdjVectorBQM`` and ``AdjDictBQM`` are now aliases for
    ``BinaryQuadraticModel`` and ``DictBQM`` respectively rather than
    having their own implementation with a slightly different API.
    They were previously deprecated in dimod 0.10.0.
  - |
    The ``dimod.bqm`` namespace has been removed.
  - |
    The ``dimod.core.bqm`` namespace has been removed.
