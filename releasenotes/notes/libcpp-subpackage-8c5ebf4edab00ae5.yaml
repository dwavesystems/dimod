    Break ``dimod/libcpp.pxd`` into a full Cython subpackage to mirror the
    structure under ``dimod/include/``. This allows for better organization,
    and less need to recompile all Cython files when changing parts of the
    C++ library. Packages that depend on dimod are still encouraged to
    use the ``from dimod.libcpp cimport ...`` syntax.
