features:
  - |
    ``QuadraticModel.energies``, ``QuadraticModel.energy``,
    ``BinaryQuadraticModel.energies``, and ``BinaryQuadraticModel.energy`` now
    all support samples containing a superset of the variables in the model.
    Any variables not in the model are ignored when calculating the energy.
fixes:
  - |
    ``BinaryQuadraticModel.energies`` now has consistent behaviour accross all
    data types when given samples containing a superset of the variables in the
    model. Previously binary quadratic models with ``object`` data type would
    allow a superset of variables, while ``float64`` and ``float32`` would not.
