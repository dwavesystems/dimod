    Add methods to construct a constrained quadratic model from other model
    types:

    * ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_discrete_quadratic_model`` with an alias
      ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_dqm``
    * ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_quadratic_model`` with two aliases
      ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_qm`` and ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_bqm``
