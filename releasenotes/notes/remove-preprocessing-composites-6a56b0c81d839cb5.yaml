    Some composites were migrated to
    `dwave-preprocessing <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-preprocessing>`_
    in dimod0.10.0. Trying to import and use these composites from dimod now
    raises an exception rather than a warning. The affected composites:

    * ``ClipComposite``
    * ``ConnectedComponentsComposite``
    * ``FixedVariableComposite``
    * ``RoofDualityComposite``
    * ``ScaleComposite``
    * ``SpinReversalTransformComposite``

    The ``fix_variables()`` was migrated to
    `dwave-preprocessing <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-preprocessing>`_
    in dimod 0.10.0. Trying to import and use it now raises an exception
    rather than a warning.
