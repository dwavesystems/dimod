features:
  - |
    Use C++ `BinaryQuadraticModel` rather than `AdjVectorBQM` as the underlying
    object in `cyDiscreteQuadraticModel`. This means that the underlying
    implementation is now version controlled.
upgrade:
  - |
    Use C++ `BinaryQuadraticModel` rather than `AdjVectorBQM` as the underlying
    object in `cyDiscreteQuadraticModel`. Any code that relied on the old
    `AdjVectorBQM` implementation will need to be upgraded.
