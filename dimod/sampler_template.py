"""
The sampler template provides an API that different samplers can use.
The crux of the API is four methods and a property.

Methods:

- sample_ising
- sample_qubo
- sample_structured_ising
- sample_structured_qubo

Property:

- structure

For many samplers, the `structure` property will be None and the
structured and unstructured variants of the methods will do the
same thing. See Structured Samplers section below.


Examples
--------
Define a sampler that operates on QUBO problems:

>>> class MyLinearSampler(dimod.TemplateSampler):
...     @dimod.decorators.qubo(1)
...     def sample_qubo(self, Q):
...         response = dimod.BinaryResponse()
...
...         sample = {}
...         for (u, v) in Q:
...             if u != v:
...                 raise ValueError()
...
...             if Q[(u, v)] > 0:
...                 val = 0
...             else:
...                 val = 1
...
...             sample[v] = val
...
...         response.add_sample(sample, Q=Q)
...         return response

This will now behave as expected

>>> Q = {(0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 0}
>>> response = MyLinearSampler().sample_qubo(Q)
>>> list(response.samples())
[{0: 0, 1: 1}]

Also, by implementing one of the methods, we now can use the others.

>>> h = {0: -1, 1: 2}
>>> J = {}
>>> response = MyLinearSampler().sample_ising(h, J)
>>> list(response.samples())
[{0: 1, 1: -1}]

Similarly for the structured methods.

>>> h = {0: -1, 1: 2}
>>> J = {}
>>> response = MyLinearSampler().sample_structured_ising(h, J)
>>> list(response.samples())
[{0: 1, 1: -1}]
>>> Q = {(0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 0}
>>> response = MyLinearSampler().sample_structured_qubo(Q)
>>> list(response.samples())
[{0: 0, 1: 1}]

However, if we assign a structure to our sampler, the structured
methods will no longer work.

>>> sampler = MyLinearSampler()
>>> sampler.structure = 'linear'
>>> try:
...     sampler.sample_structured_qubo({})
... except RecursionError:  # infinite recursion
...     print('not implemented')  # python3
... except RuntimeError:
...     print('not implemented')  # python2
'not implemented'

Structured Samplers
-------------------

Some samplers can only operate on a particular problem structure.
Most commonly this happens when there is a particular problem graph.
In this case, `sample_structured_ising` and `sample_sturctured_qubo`
would require the user to provide an Ising problem or QUBO of the
appropriate structure. `sample_ising` and `sample_qubo` could either
fail when the structure is not provided, but more commonly would
make an attempt to change the structure to fit. These sorts of
embedding techniques are discussed here:
