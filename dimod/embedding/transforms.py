def unembed_response(target_response, embedding, source_bqm, chain_break_method=None):
    """Unembed the response.

    Construct a response for the source binary quadratic model (BQM) by unembedding the given
    response from the target BQM.

    Args:
        target_response (:obj:`.Response`):
            Response from the target BQM.

        embedding (dict):
            Mapping from source graph to target graph as a dict of form {s: {t, ...}, ...},
            where s is a source-model variable and t is a target-model variable.

        source_bqm (:obj:`.BinaryQuadraticModel`):
            Source binary quadratic model.

        chain_break_method (function, optional, default=:func:`.majority_vote`):
            Method used to resolve chain breaks.

    Returns:
        :obj:`.Response`

    Examples:
        This example embeds a Boolean AND gate,
        :math:`x_3 \Leftrightarrow x_1 \wedge x_2`, in a square-structured
        graph and samples with dimod reference structured sampler,
        `StructureComposite`, using the dimod reference `ExactSolver` sampler.
        The gate is represented as penalty model
        :math:`x_1 x_2 - 2(x_1+x_2)x_3 +3x_3`, which is submitted to the
        sampler as QUBO  problem
        :math:`E(a_i, b_{i,j}; x_i) = 3x_3 + x_1x_2 - 2x_1x_3 - 2x_2x_3`.
        This QUBO represents a fully connected :math:`K_3` graph.
        Samples are unembedded by :func:`.unembed_response` and show that
        only valid states of the AND gate have zero energy (e.g., only input
        :math:`x_1 x_2=1,1` results in :math:`z=1`), while invalid states have
        higher energy.
