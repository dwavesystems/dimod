    """Return the QUBO with ground states corresponding to a minimum TSP route.

    If :math:`|G|` is the number of nodes in the graph, the resulting qubo will have:

    * :math:`|G|^2` variables/nodes
    * :math:`2 |G|^2 (|G| - 1)` interactions/edges

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A complete graph in which each edge has a attribute giving its weight.

    lagrange : number, optional (default None)
        Lagrange parameter to weight constraints (no edges within set)
        versus objective (largest set possible).

    weight : optional (default 'weight')
        The name of the edge attribute containing the weight.
    
    missing_edge_weight : number, optional (default None)
        For bi-directional graphs, the weight given to missing edges.
        If None is given (the default), missing edges will be set to
        the sum of all weights.

    Returns
    -------
    QUBO : dict
       The QUBO with ground states corresponding to a minimum travelling
       salesperson route. The QUBO variables are labelled `(c, t)` where `c`
       is a node in `G` and `t` is the time index. For instance, if `('a', 0)`
       is 1 in the ground state, that means the node 'a' is visted first.
