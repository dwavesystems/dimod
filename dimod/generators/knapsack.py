    Given the number of items, generates a random knapsack problem, formulated as
    a :class:`~dimod.ConstrainedQuadraticModel`. The capacity of bins is set
    to be ``tightness_ratio`` times the sum of the weights.

    Args:
        num_items: Number of items to choose from.

        seed: Seed for NumPy random number generator.

        value_range: Range of the randomly generated values for each item.

        weight_range: Range of the randomly generated weights for each item.

        tightness_ratio: Ratio of capacity over sum of weights.

    Returns:
        The quadratic model encoding the knapsack problem. Variables are
        denoted as ``x_{i}`` where ``x_{i} == 1`` means that item ``i`` is
        placed in the knapsack.
