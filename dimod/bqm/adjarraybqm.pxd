cdef class cyAdjArrayBQM:
    """A binary quadratic model structured as two c++ vectors.

    Can be created in several ways:

        AdjArrayBQM(vartype)
            Creates an empty binary quadratic model.

        AdjArrayBQM(bqm)
            Creates a BQM from another BQM. See `copy` and `cls` kwargs below.

        AdjArrayBQM(bqm, vartype)
            Creates a BQM from another BQM, changing to the appropriate
            `vartype` if necessary.

        AdjArrayBQM(n, vartype)
            Creates a BQM with `n` variables, indexed linearly from zero,
            setting all biases to zero.

        AdjArrayBQM(quadratic, vartype)
            Creates a BQM from quadratic biases given as a square array_like_
            or a dictionary of the form `{(u, v): b, ...}`. Note that when
            formed with SPIN-variables, biases on the diagonal are added to the
            offset.

        AdjArrayBQM(linear, quadratic, vartype)
            Creates a BQM from linear and quadratic biases, where `linear` is a
            one-dimensional array_like_ or a dictionary of the form
            `{v: b, ...}`, and `quadratic` is a square array_like_ or a
            dictionary of the form `{(u, v): b, ...}`. Note that when formed
            with SPIN-variables, biases on the diagonal are added to the offset.

        AdjArrayBQM(linear, quadratic, offset, vartype)
            Creates a BQM from linear and quadratic biases, where `linear` is a
            one-dimensional array_like_ or a dictionary of the form
            `{v: b, ...}`, and `quadratic` is a square array_like_ or a
            dictionary of the form `{(u, v): b, ...}`, and `offset` is a
            numerical offset. Note that when formed with SPIN-variables, biases
            on the diagonal are added to the offset.

    Notes:

        The AdjArrayBQM is implemented using two c++ vectors. The first
        vector contains the linear biases and the index of the start of each
        variable's neighborhood in the second vector. The second
        vector contains the neighboring variables and their associated quadratic
        biases. The vectors, once initialized, are not resized.

        Advantages:

        - Very fast iteration over the biases

        Disadvantages:
        
        - Does not support incremental construction
        - Only supports float64 biases

        Intended Use:
        
        - When performance is important and the BQM can be treated as read-only

    Examples:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from dimod import AdjArrayBQM

        >>> # Construct from a numpy array
        >>> AdjArrayBQM(np.triu(np.ones((2, 2))), 'BINARY')
        AdjArrayBQM({0: 1.0, 1: 1.0}, {(0, 1): 1.0}, 0.0, 'BINARY')

        >>> # Construct from dicts
        >>> AdjArrayBQM({'a': -1}, {('a', 'b'): 1}, 'SPIN')
        AdjArrayBQM({a: -1.0, b: 0.0}, {('a', 'b'): 1.0}, 0.0, 'SPIN')
