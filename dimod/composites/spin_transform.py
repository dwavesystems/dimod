    """Composite for applying spin reversal transform preprocessing.

    Spin reversal transforms (or "gauge transformations") are applied
    by flipping the spin of variables in the Ising problem. We can
    then sample using the transformed Ising problem and flip the same
    bits in the resulting sample.

    Args:
        sampler: A dimod sampler object.

    Examples:
        Composing a sampler.

        >>> base_sampler = dimod.ExactSolver()
        >>> composed_sampler = dimod.SpinReversalTransform(base_sampler)

        The composed sampler can now be used as a dimod sampler.

        >>> h = {0: -1, 1: 1}
        >>> response = composed_sampler.sample_ising(h, {})
        >>> list(response.samples())
        [{0: 1, 1: -1}, {0: -1, 1: -1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: -1, 1: 1}]

        The base sampler is also in `children` attribute of the composed
        sampler.

        >>> base_sampler in composed_sampler.children
        True
