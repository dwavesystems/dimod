# The following traversal code is adapted from NetworkX's implementation. The
# only thing that was preventing their implementation from using BQMs directly
# was the not_implemented_for decorator. So rather than force the construction
# of a new NetworkX graph, we just skip that decorator (and make some other
# small changes). Modifications are licensed under the Apache 2.0 Software
# license at the top.
