"""
Samplers can be composed. The `composite pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern>`_
allows layers of pre- and post-processing to be applied to binary quadratic programs without needing
to change the underlying sampler implementation.

We refer to these layers as `composites`. Each composed sampler must
include at least one sampler, and possibly many composites.

Each composed sampler is itself a dimod sampler with all of the
included methods and parameters. In this way complex samplers
can be constructed.

The dimod :class:`.ComposedSampler` abstract base class inherits from :class:`.Sampler` class
its abstract methods, properties, and mixins (for example, a `sample_Ising` method) and from
:class:`.Composite` class the `children` property and `child` mixin (`children` being a list of
supported samplers with `child` providing the first).

Examples:
    The :class:`~dimod.reference.composites.higherordercomposites.HigherOrderComposite`
    converts a binary quadratic model sampler to a binary polynomial sampler.
    Given dimod sampler :class:`.ExactSolver` for example, the composed sampler is
    used as any dimod sampler:

    >>> sampler = dimod.ExactSolver()
    >>> composed_sampler = dimod.HigherOrderComposite(sampler)
    >>> J = {("a", "b", "c"): 1}
    >>> sampleset = composed_sampler.sample_hising({}, J)
    >>> set(sampleset.first.sample.values()) == {-1}
    True

    For more examples, see the source code for the composed
    documented in :ref:`quadratic_composites`.
